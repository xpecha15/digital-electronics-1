### 2-bit comparator

1. Karnaugh maps for other two functions:

   Greater than:

   ![K-maps](images/kmap_greater.png)

   Less than:

   ![K-maps](images/kmap_less.png)

2. Equations of simplified SoP (Sum of the Products) form of the "greater than" function and simplified PoS (Product of the Sums) form of the "less than" function.

### 4-bit comparator

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`testbench.vhd`) with at least one assert (use BCD codes of your student ID digits as input combinations). Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   Last two digits of my student ID: **xxxx26**

```vhdl
    --------------------------------------------------------
    -- Data generation process
    --------------------------------------------------------
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the beginning of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        -- First test case ...
        s_b <= "0010"; s_a <= "0110"; wait for 100 ns;--ID: xxxx26
        -- ... and its expected outputs
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = '0') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = '0') and
                (s_B_less_A    = '1'))
        -- If false, then report an error
        -- If true, then do not report anything
        report "Input combination 0010, 0110 FAILED" severity error;

        -- Report a note at the end of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait; -- Data generation process is suspended forever
    end process p_stimulus;
```

2. Text console screenshot during your simulation, including reports.
